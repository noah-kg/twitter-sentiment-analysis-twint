# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Twint

This is an experiment to see if I can perform some sentiment analysis on Twitter using Twint, and NLTK libraries. My goals for this project are the following:

* Successfully implement Twint to scrape Twitter
* Filter and clean scraped results
* Implement NLTK to tokenize, stem, and lemmatize the tweets
* Calculate the subjectivity and polarity of tweets using TextBlob (or some other library)
* Analyze and visualize the results
